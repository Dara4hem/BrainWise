# Employee Management System - Backend (Django) Documentation

This documentation details the backend architecture for the Employee Management System. It is designed to answer key questions such as:

- **How is authentication handled?**
- **What are the main data models and their relationships?**
- **How is role-based access implemented?**
- **What is the employee workflow, and how are status changes managed?**
- **How are events logged and errors tracked?**
- **What API endpoints are available?**
- **How are testing and future improvements addressed?**

---

## 1. Overview

The backend is built with **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**, ensuring a scalable, secure, and maintainable system. It incorporates JWT token-based authentication and role-based access control to manage different user types (Admins, Managers, and Employees). This section answers fundamental queries like:

- *"What authentication method is used?"*
- *"How is user data secured?"*

---

## 2. Technologies & Tools

- **Django**: For rapid development with clean and modular design.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: To create robust and RESTful APIs.
- **JWT Authentication**: Ensures secure, token-based API access.
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: Database systems for reliable data storage.
- **Django Admin Panel**: Provides a user-friendly interface for data management.
- **Logging (Python logging)**: Captures key events and errors, aiding in troubleshooting.
- **Automated Testing**: Unit and integration tests verify core functionalities.

_Key Questions:_
- How are requests authenticated?
- What frameworks ensure data integrity?

## 3. Data Models & Relationships

### User Model
- **Extends**: Django’s `AbstractUser`.
- **Key Fields**: `role` (admin, manager, employee), `company` (ForeignKey), and `phone_number`.
- **Purpose**: Supports role-based access and links to employee profiles.

### Company Model
- **Stores**: Company details.
- **Relationships**: Connects with departments and users.
  
### Department Model
- **Linked To**: A specific company.
- **Stores**: Department name and related data.

### Employee Model
- **One-to-One**: Linked with a User.
- **Associations**: Connected to a Company and a Department.
- **Key Fields**: `designation`, `hired_on`, and `status`.
- **Employee Workflow**: 
  - **Status Transitions**: 
    - `application_received` → `interview_scheduled` → `hired` or `not_accepted`
  - **Method**: `change_status(new_status)` validates transitions and logs every change.

_Key Questions:_
- What is the employee workflow?
- How are invalid transitions handled and logged?

---

## 4. Key Features & Implementation

### Authentication & Role-Based Access
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure login via the `/api/token/` endpoint.
- **Role Filtering**: 
  - **Admins**: Access all data.
  - **Managers**: Access data related to their company.
  - **Employees**: Access only their own records.

### Employee Workflow & Status Management
- The `change_status(new_status)` method ensures that only valid transitions occur.
- **Logging**: Every successful status change and invalid attempt is recorded using Python’s logging library.
- **Error Handling**: Invalid transitions raise errors with clear messages.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                              | Description                                                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/api/token/`                         | Obtain a JWT token for authentication.                          |
| `GET`  | `/api/users/`                         | Retrieve a list of users (access based on role).                  |
| `GET`  | `/api/companies/`                     | View companies (accessible by admins and managers).             |
| `GET`  | `/api/departments/`                   | Retrieve departments within a company.                          |
| `GET`  | `/api/employees/`                     | List employees (admins see all; managers see their company’s employees; employees see their own record). |
| `POST` | `/api/employees/`                     | Create a new employee (restricted to managers).                 |
| `PATCH`| `/api/employees/<id>/change-status/`   | Update an employee’s status following the defined workflow.     |

_Key Questions:_
- What endpoints are available for managing employees?
- How are permissions enforced at each endpoint?

### Logging & Testing

- **Logging**:  
  All key events (e.g., status changes, errors) are logged for traceability.
  
- **Automated Testing**:  
  Comprehensive tests (unit tests via Django’s `TestCase` and integration tests via DRF’s `APITestCase`) verify:
  - Valid and invalid status transitions.
  - Proper functioning of API endpoints.
  
_Key Questions:_
- How is logging configured?
- What tests are in place to ensure system reliability?

## 5. How It Works

1. **Data Modeling with Django ORM**  
   - Relationships between companies, departments, users, and employees are clearly defined.

2. **Authentication & Permissions**  
   - Secure endpoints with JWT.
   - Role-based filtering in views ensures that each user sees only the relevant data.

3. **Employee Workflow Management**  
   - The workflow mechanism validates transitions (e.g., from `application_received` to `interview_scheduled`).
   - Logging captures each change for audit purposes.

4. **API Communication**  
   - RESTful API endpoints facilitate CRUD operations on all entities.
   - Endpoints are designed for scalability and ease of integration with the frontend.

5. **Testing & Logging**  
   - Automated tests guarantee stability and correct behavior.
   - Logging helps in identifying issues and tracking user actions.

_Key Questions:_
- How do different components (authentication, workflow, logging) interact?
- What improvements are planned for future releases?

---

## 6. Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Logging**: Add more detailed logs, including API request/response data.
- **Database Optimization**: Consider migrating to PostgreSQL for better performance and scalability.
- **Advanced Permissions**: Implement finer-grained role-based access controls.
- **Chatbot Enhancements**: Improve natural language processing for a more intuitive documentation assistant.
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize queries and API responses for large-scale deployments.

This comprehensive backend design is integral to the Employee Management System, providing secure authentication, robust employee management workflows, detailed logging for troubleshooting, and reliable API endpoints. It is structured to answer key questions and support both current and future development needs.
